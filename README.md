# CapitaBankingApplication

A large group project created as part of a group for the capita full stack training.

My team developed a full CRUD system (Create, Read, Update and Delete) using JDBC. It is intended to be used as a bank teller and allows you to create personal, business and ISA accounts and provides functionality for depositing, withdrawing, sending money to other accounts and more.
